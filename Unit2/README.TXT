Well these are the Unit 2 programs that I am actually doing this time, and not really
because I care, but mostly because I do need the practice and the grade booster. It should
be known that I hate this kind of busy work. I believe these are due on the 4th of October,
2017. Written by Kale Miller. You only need to credit me. I would love for you to notify me
on github if you are using my work, but you don't have to.
